<h2>jQuery Mobile Swipe Up and Swipe Down</h2>
<p>jQuery Mobile natively provides us with the ability to capture the swipeleft and swiperight. It 
does not however offer us swipeup and swipedown out of the box. jQuery Swipe Up and Swipe Down is 
an adaptation of what the jQuery team has done for swipeleft and swiperight. Include this plugin in 
your application to allow binding to swipeup and swipedown events.</p>
